## How to Run Tests
_Under Construction_

A KO is comprised of a deployment.yaml, metadata.json, service.yaml, and src folder
with an index.js. Running test.py with the specific baseindex.js for the KO will create
an index.js for the KO with the recommendation(s) from the MAGICapp. Copy this index.js into the src folder of the KO and compress the KO into a .zip file to upload
to the KGrid Library.
